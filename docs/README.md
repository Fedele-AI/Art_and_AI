## Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of intelligent behavior. AI systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The goal of AI is to develop systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

To help you better understand AI fundamentals, we have created a series of tutorials covering key concepts and techniques in the field. Whether you are new to AI or looking to deepen your knowledge, these tutorials will provide you with a solid foundation in artificial intelligence.

## Table of Contents
The following topics are covered in this series, and it is expected that you'll watch them in order first to get a good understanding of the basics of AI.

- [1. Ising Model](aibasics/isingmodel.md)
- [2. Linear Perceptron](aibasics/linearperceptron.md)
- [3. Deep Perceptron](aibasics/deepperceptron.md)
